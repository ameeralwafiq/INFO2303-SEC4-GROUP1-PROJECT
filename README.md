## 'Triple Tree Suites'
## 'Triple Tree Suites' is a website for a hotel that based in Malaysia.
## 1. Project Description
Malaysia is home to a multicultural society, with Malay, Chinese, and Indians making up
the majority of the ethnicities. Therefore, Malaysia has a lot of interesting tourist
destinations due to the plethora of different cultural experiences. Therefore,
Triple Trees Suites aim to become a luxurious hotel providing triple the hospitality and
experience from any hotel, which can house tourists from all around the world. We strive
to become the best hosts by giving tourists a wonderful stay to bring the best out of Malaysia.

Six primary pages make up our website: home, attraction, booking, room, about us, and contact.
For this website project, our primary font is Ubuntu. With beige and dark green olive as our
major colours, the overall design of our website is striking yet straightforward and inviting.
Apart from that, it is extremely simple for the visitor to use the button to get more details
or reserve a room at Triple Tree Suites.

When it comes to managing our team and organisation, we have our own procedures and style.
First and foremost, we manage our system by setting up the home page to sincerely welcome our
customers to spend the night in our hotel and to place their trust in us for the services that
we can offer throughout their stay. The visitor can continue by navigating the website in accordance
with their preferences.

For instance, if a guest needs to look for a room, they can do so by selecting the room button,
or if they wish to stay the night, they can select the booking button. We provide the guests with
a wide range of options based on their preferences and needs. Visitors can get in touch with us
using the page's contact information by using the address, location, and social media profiles
indicated there. About the most recent news and promotional material for our hotel, guests can also
follow us on social media. Additionally, it prioritises our regular check-ins and having comfortable
lodging at our hotel.

Our ultimate objective in developing this website is to inform as many visitors as we can about
Triple Tree Suites. Additionally, we hope to reach the guest's degree of satisfaction and contentment.
Visitors will not think twice about staying and using our services whenever they want if we do this.
